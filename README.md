# Hi I'm Mikael 👋
## 👨🏽‍💻🤸🏽‍♂️☕️
### Welcome to my github! 
#### I like to consider myself a Software Engineer, [martial arts tricker](https://www.youtube.com/c/MikaelMantis), and an amateur at-home barista. 

Some projects I'm actively working on:
- [Vertigo Tricking](https://vertigotricking.com) (private repo 😬)
- [US Tricking](https://github.com/USTricking/USTricking.com)
- 😃 [my own website](https://mikaelmantis.com)
- maybe others soon... 👀

###### Please enjoy one of my favorite quotes ever, from my favorite animated dog:
