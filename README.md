# Hi, I'm Mikael 👋
## 👨🏽‍💻🤸🏽‍♂️☕️
### Welcome to my GitHub! 
#### I'm a Software Engineer, a [tricker](https://www.youtube.com/c/MikaelMantis), and a proud Aussie dog dad 😄. 
Most projects you'll find here are tricking related... 
#### but what is tricking?
Tricking, is most easily described as a movement sport/art that combines elements from martial arts, gymnastics, and dancing into performative strings of acrobatics. 

🔭 I’m currently building some nifty UI for the next generation of networking at [Aalyria](https://aalyria.com)

Some side projects I'm also working on/maintaining:
- [The TrickingAPI](https://trickingapi.dev)
- [USTricking](https://github.com/ustricking)
- [BattleGavel](https://battle-gavel.vercel.app)
- [My personal website](https://mikaelmantis.com)
